# Create a Unit Test for a Simple Apex Class
Create and install a simple Apex class to test if a date is within a proper range, and if not, returns a date that occurs at the end of the month within the range. You'll copy the code for the class from GitHub. Then write unit tests that achieve 100% code coverage.
- Create an Apex class:
  - Name: VerifyDate
  - Code: Copy from GitHub
- Place the unit tests in a separate test class:
  - Name: TestVerifyDate
  - Goal: 100% code coverage
- Run your test class at least once
