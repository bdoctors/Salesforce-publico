# Set Checkpoints to Find Errors in Your Code
Set a checkpoint in the EmailMissionSpecialist class. Then execute the class and analyze the objects logged at the checkpoint.

**Pre-Work**
Make sure that line 12 of your EmailMissionSpecialist Apex class contains this code:
Messaging.SendEmailResult[] results = Messaging.sendEmail(

If it doesn't, replace the contents of EmailMissionSpecialist.apxc with the EmailMissionSpecialist class code provided in Unit 2: Navigate and Edit Source Code.

- In the EmailMissionSpecialist class, set a checkpoint on line 12
- Using your own email address, execute the EmailMissionSpecialist class in the Execute Anonymous window.
- Observe the checkpoint results and see the values of the objects in memory (we wonâ€™t check this)
