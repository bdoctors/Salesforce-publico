**The Developer Console is connected to one org and is browser-based**. If you want your changes to be effective immediately and you don’t want to install anything on your computer, we recommend the Developer Console. If you want to connect to multiple orgs, compare or synchronize files, or use version control, the Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code is your best option.

Note
**The Developer Console doesn’t have version control or conflict resolution**. To avoid overwriting other people’s code, be careful when you use the Developer Console in orgs that you share with your teammates.
