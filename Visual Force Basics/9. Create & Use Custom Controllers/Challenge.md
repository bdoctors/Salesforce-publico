# Create a Visualforce page that displays new cases
Create a Visualforce page that uses a custom controller to display a list of cases with the status of New.

Challenge Requirements
- Create a new Visualforce page:
  - Label: NewCaseList
  - Name: NewCaseList
- Create a custom Apex controller:
  - Name: NewCaseListController
  - Include a publicly scoped method named **getNewCases**
  - Use the return type of **List<Case>**
  - Return a list of case records that includes the **ID** and **CaseNumber** fields
  - Filter the results returned to only have a status of **New**
- The NewCaseList Visualforce page must use an **apex:repeat** component, which is:
  - Bound to **newCases**
  - Refers to the var attribute as **case**
  - With the component tags, bind an **apex:outputLink** component to the **ID** of the case. This will cause the the page to direct the user to the detail page of the respective case record.
